The intangible cultural heritage of the Assyrian community in Lebanon, deeply rooted in their religious beliefs, is passed down through families and Assyrian parishes, clubs, and a school. Folk dances, are considered one of the markers of Assyrian identity, and are mainly performed during religious (e.g. Christmas) and, life events or secular (e.g. Akitu) holidays. During these events, individuals of all ages come together, join hands, and engage in rhythmic foot tapping and expressive hand and shoulder movements, accompanied by traditional or modern Assyrian music. The most common Assyrian dances performed are Shora, Khigga Yaqoora, Dimdimma, and Ghawerrah. These dances typically take the form of circle dances performed in a line with an open end. The head of the line, referred to as "Resha", usually dances with a handkerchief adorned with beads or bells so it jingles when shaken.
